# Proposed Training: Git and Release Management for Python Applications in Azure
## Overview
This one-day, on-site workshop is designed to help your team build confidence with Git and establish a clear, auditable process for developing, testing, and releasing your Python applications.

The focus will be **practical and hands-on**: most of our time will be spent working directly with Git and walking through real scenarios. Short theoretical sections will only be used to establish shared vocabulary and meaning.

By the end of the day, your team will leave with a clear “happy path” workflow, a supporting cheat sheet, and the ability to handle common issues — including knowing when and how to get help from an LLM (AI assistant) for troubleshooting.

## Sections & Learning Objectives
### 1. Safety Nets and Recovery (Overview)
- Understand how Git protects against accidental mistakes and data loss.
- Learn the concepts behind Git's safety mechanisms and recovery strategies.
- Motivation: Build confidence that "Someone deleted the codebase" can't happen again.
---
### 2. Everyday Git Essentials
- Get comfortable with the commands you'll use daily: clone, commit, branch, push, pull.
- See how Git provides an auditable history of who changed what, and when.
- Motivation: Develop a shared, repeatable workflow that reduces risk.
---
### 3. Branching and GitFlow
- Learn the GitFlow model for feature development, releases, and hotfixes.
- Practice branching, merging, and tagging releases.
- Motivation: Provide structure so the team can work in parallel without overwriting each other's work.
---
### 4. Pull Requests and Code Review
- Understand how pull requests formalise review and approval.
- Practice raising and reviewing pull requests in a real repository.
- Motivation: Make the process auditable and provide quality checks before release.
---
### 5. Dealing with Merge Conflicts
- Deliberately create and resolve merge conflicts step-by-step.
- Learn strategies to prevent conflicts before they occur.
- Motivation: Build resilience for when collaboration inevitably causes overlaps.
---
### 6. Release Process in Azure
- Connect Git workflow to deployment on your Windows-based Azure environment.
- Demonstrate the path from commit → pull request → merge → release.
- Motivation: Show how disciplined Git use directly supports reliable deployments.
---
### 7. Documenting the Process
- Capture a step-by-step workflow and branching diagram tailored to your team.
- Create a lightweight "cheat sheet" to follow after the training.
- Motivation: Ensure consistency, accountability, and ease of adoption.

## Where AI Fits In
Throughout the day, we will highlight practical points where consulting an LLM (such as ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot) is useful:
- **When things go wrong**: error messages, merge conflicts, or cryptic Git behaviour.
- **When you need examples**: deployment scripts, rollback strategies, or command syntax.
- **When drafting documentation**: generating initial drafts for your process guide, then refining it with your own context.
Motivation: Show how AI can accelerate troubleshooting and documentation without replacing the need for human understanding and oversight.

## Outcomes
By the end of this training, your team will:
- Have a working, auditable Git process aligned with GitFlow.
- Be confident in day-to-day Git operations and recovery strategies.
- Know how to perform code reviews and manage pull requests.
- Understand how their Git process connects to Azure releases.
- Leave with a tailored workflow diagram and cheat sheet for ongoing use.
